For representing a user hierarchy in an SQL database, there are many options like 
-Adjacency List
-Nested Set (or Modified Preorder Tree Traversal)
-Nested Intervals (Mix of Nested Set & Materialized Path)
-Flat Table (Adding Levels & Rank to Adjacency List)
-Lineage Column (Materialized Path, Path Enumeration)
-Multiple Lineage Columns

And almost all of them have their advantages and limitations


But for this test I prefer to use a generic, portable technique where data is mostly read. It save me from writing 
queries that involve joining the table back on itself which is usually the case when storing heirachy relationship
in the same row as the node.
